_Abstract:_ the cerebellum is a fundamental component of the vertebrate brain that
is mainly responsible for physical coordination and movement learning. Its internal
working mechanisms are still beyond understanding mainly due to the inability of
expert neuroscientists to confidently classify observed cells in the cerebellar cortex
based on their electrophysiological behavior, this is, the way in which neurons
conduct electricity. Thanks to the advances in microchip technology and computational
power, it is now possible to use machine learning to translate this biological
problem into a multi-label classification one. In this study, neuron samples previously
taken from the mouse cerebellum were processed and analyzed to feed a set of
unsupervised and supervised methodologies with state-of-the-art modeling features
that allowed the identification and prediction of four of the five types of cells that
constitute the cerebellar cortex: Purkinje, Golgi, Granule, and Mossy Fibers, with
precision levels that outperform a baseline model set according to expertsâ€™ assessment.
